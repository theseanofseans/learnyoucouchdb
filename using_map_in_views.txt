 USING MAP IN VIEWS
 Exercise 3 of 4

Views are the primary tool used for querying and reporting on CouchDB documents.

Create a view for the database things-learn-couchdb which will just output all
the things which have the material metal.

The database was already created by this exercise in your CouchDB.

The database is located at http://localhost:5984/things-learn-couchdb
and an example document in this database looks like:

    {
      "_id": "4a7bd4d6e47564639585459049000e15",
      "_rev": "1-eb84340e9061ff439f24e6ee56e5d8b1",
      "material": "metal",
      "name": "spoon"
    }

The value in the view for each items that is made from metal
should be the whole document.

Example response for 1 element:

    { "total_rows": 1,
      "offset":0,
      "rows":[{
        "id": "4a7bd4d6e47564639585459049001d6b",
        "key": null,
        "value": {
          "_id":"4a7bd4d6e47564639585459049001d6b",
          "_rev": "1-1ca9e59b14f0a3fdc71e0cb401f8c6f7",
          "name": "spoon",
          "material": "metal"
        }
      }]
    }

The _id for the design document should should be _design/thingsMadeOfMetal
and the name for the view should be thingsMadeOfMetal.

This will result in a view that can be queried at
http://localhost:5984/things-learn-couchdb/_design/thingsMadeOfMetal/_view/thingsMadeOfMetal

## HINTS

You can use curl or a http client in whatever programming language you
want to use.

When you are done, you must run:

    $ learnyoucouchdb verify

to proceed. The result will be tested, a report will be generated,
and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
