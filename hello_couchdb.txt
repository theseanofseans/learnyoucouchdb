 HELLO COUCHDB
 Exercise 2 of 4

Start Apache CouchDB and create a database named couchdbschool by
using HTTP.

After you created the database, please insert this document:

    {
      "_id": "robert",
      "type": "human"
    }

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## HINTS

You can use curl or a http client in whatever programming language you
want to use.

When you are done, you must run:

    $ learnyoucouchdb verify

to proceed. The result will be tested, a report will be generated,
and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
